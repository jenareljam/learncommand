===========================
== Introduction

Learning the Linux command-line is difficult - particularly because it is
initially so boring. After using a GUI for years, navigating through typing
seems exceptionally obtuse. When learning the very first commands: cd, pwd, 
ls, less, mkdir, mv, cp, rm, etc., tutorials often suggest brief, pointless
exercises to reinforce the use of these commands. These exercises usually 
take the form of, "Type 'ls' and see what it does. Now type 'ls -l' and
notice the difference." Boring boring boring. Good luck getting your average
high school (or younger) kid interested in that. Much more fun to give up 
and play some video games.

So, lets make it a game. 

In this project, we don't attempt to teach the linux command-line. Many 
people have already put together great guides that walk new users through
the different basic commands (For instance, linuxcommand.org). Instead, we 
attempt to provide a flexible training environment to reinforce basic 
commands, so they become second-nature, in a fun way.
